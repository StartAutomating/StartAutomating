title: Solve IT Together
---

More often than not, when you pay for training, you get the tip of an iceberg.  A prewritten class will cover something hopefully related to what you want to learn, and you then have to figure out how to adapt it to your problem.

At Start-Automating, we prefer to do things a little differently.

We provide private small scale training and codevelopment in flexibly scheduled sessions.

During these sessions, we:

* Talk thru your problem with you
* Help you understand the concepts involved
* Write scripts with you
* Debug scripts you can't quite figure out
* Discuss techniques, tools, and trade-offs in development

Many people learn by doing and discussing.  If that sounds like something you'd like, let's Solve IT Together.

You can book Solve IT Together sessions by [sponsoring us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/StartAutomating).
