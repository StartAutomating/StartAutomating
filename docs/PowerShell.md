PowerShell is a cross-platform scripting language built by Microsoft.

PowerShell is probably the best engine for automation written since the dawn of programming.

PowerShell is incredibly powerful and versatile.

It lets you easily automate almost anything, including:

* RESTful apis
* Regular Expressions
* .NET apis
* Terminal Applications

Everything you automate in PowerShell flows thru the Object Pipeline.

This allows you to cohesively build complex solutions with minimal effort.

There are thousands of modules 

We helped build the PowerShell language, and we love helping people improve their productivity with PowerShell.

We offer several [Services](/Services/) to help you supercharge your scripting.
